            <p class="para">
                When we talk about mental health, there is often a misconception about what it is and who it affects. First and foremost, mental health is not the same as a mental health issue. 
    We esd/proj have mental health. It does not come and go; it’s with us constantly throughout our lifetime.
            </p>
            <br>
            <P class="para">
                We provide easy options of having online or either offline services for counselling.

            <br>
            <p class="para">
                It is just the same as the idea of physical health, only, unlike physical health, there are no tests we can take to check how mentesd/projy healthy we are, and we cannot always see from the outside when we are in poor mental health. 
    It’s a very personal, individual sense of who we are and how we feel.
            </p>

                    Mental health is often used interchangeably with the terms emotional health and well-being - and our mental state is certainly a key part of our overesd/proj well-being. 
        It refers to the way in which we are aware of our own abilities and how well we cope with the ups and downs of life.

                <li>
                    Counselling involves talking about your problems with a trained mental health professional such as a counsellor or psychotherapist. Talking therapies can help you to talk freely, without fear of criticism or judgement, 
        understand what may have caused your problems and how to manage them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="para">
                In many situations, counseling can help individuals overcome previous trauma or mental and emotional roadblocks so they can reduce stress and anxiety, avoid emotional triggers, 
    form healthy relationships, and take other positive steps.
